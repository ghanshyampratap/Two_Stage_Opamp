#  Two-Stage CMOS Operational Amplifier – 90nm | Cadence Virtuoso

##  Abstract
This project presents the design and simulation of a **two-stage CMOS operational amplifier** implemented in **90nm CMOS technology** using **Cadence Virtuoso**.  
The op-amp operates at **1.2 V** supply and targets:

- **Open-loop gain:** 80 dB  
- **GBW:** 20 MHz  
- **Slew rate:** 10 V/μs  
- **Load capacitance:** 1 pF  
- **ICMR:** 0.5 V – 1.0 V  

The architecture includes:

- PMOS input differential pair  
- NMOS current mirror load  
- Common-source second stage  
- Miller compensation  

Transistor dimensions, bias currents, and compensation capacitor were optimized through iterative simulation.  
Simulation results confirm that the amplifier meets design goals and is suitable for mixed-signal and low-power analog applications.

##  Introduction
Operational amplifiers are essential building blocks in analog and mixed-signal ICs, used in:

- Amplification  
- Filtering  
- Data conversion  
- Mathematical analog operations  

With CMOS technology scaling down, low-voltage operation becomes challenging due to reduced headroom and limited gain.  
This project addresses these challenges by designing a **two-stage CMOS op-amp** using **90nm GPDK** in Cadence Virtuoso.

###  Primary Design Goals
- 80 dB open-loop gain  
- 20 MHz gain-bandwidth product  
- 10 V/μs slew rate  
- Stable operation with 1 pF load  
- ICMR: 0.5–1.0 V  
- 1.2 V supply operation  

The amplifier uses a differential first stage and high-gain second stage with Miller compensation to maintain stability.

##  Working
The amplifier is designed using **90nm CMOS technology** and consists of:

###  Key Components
- **M3, M4** – PMOS differential pair  
- **M1, M2** – NMOS current mirror load  
- **M5** – NMOS tail current source (6 μA)  
- **M7** – NMOS common-source second stage  
- **M6** – PMOS active load  
- **M8** – PMOS current mirror for biasing  
- **Cc** – 400 fF Miller compensation capacitor  

###  Working Principle
- PMOS differential pair amplifies input difference  
- NMOS current mirror converts differential current to voltage  
- Second-stage NMOS (M7) boosts gain and drives the output  
- PMOS load (M6) increases gain  
- Miller capacitor (Cc) ensures stability and adequate phase margin  
- Tail current (M5) sets gm and impacts slew rate  
- Bias circuit (M8) generates reference currents
